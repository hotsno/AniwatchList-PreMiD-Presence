# AniwatchList PreMiD Presence
To install this:
- `git clone https://github.com/hotsno/AniwatchList-PreMiD-Presence` in any folder
- Copy the "src" folder somewhere where you can permanently store it
- In the PreMiD extension, hold shift, press "Load presence" and choose the src folder
- You can delete the folder made from the `git clone` afterwards

I tried to get this officially added to the PreMiD store but they said the presence/site was too low quality (ouch). I'll try again later once they're both improved lol
